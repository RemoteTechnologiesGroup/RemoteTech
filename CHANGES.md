Version 1.8.0
=============
Released October 15, 2016

KSP 1.2 update

What's New?
===========

* Ported the RemoteTech code base to KSP 1.2. [#678]

* Add and option to enable / disable CommNet alongside RemoteTech.
* Moved all RT antennas to the new Communication category in VAB / SPH.
* Added RemoteTech RLA config file. [#469]
* Antenna info in VAB /SPH indicate "range" or "power" depending on the chosen RangeModel ("range" is technically wrong when in Root model). [#471]
* Fixed an issue when the "RTAntennaTarget" field was empty in a save file. [#506]
* Exception bubbling up from KSP or other mods are now caught in RT when staging. [#525]
* Flight Computer window is now closed when switching to another vessel or leaving the flight scene.[#578]
* Added a new API to change the range of ground stations. [#589]
* Antenna range multiplier option slider is no longer snapped to 0 or 1. [#594]
* Antenna range multiplier has now a maximum value of 5 (previously 2).
* "World Scale" option sliders are now using 2 decimal places instead of 6. [#601]
* Added a new option slider: range multiplier for ground stations / mission control. [#602]
* Fixed a NRE spamming issue while transmitting science. [#613]
* Fixed various issues with the connection indicator and various UI scales. [#618 & #668]
* Kerbals can now transfer themselves even if there's no connection and they are not in a command module (this also bypass any signal delay). [#626]
* Fixed an issue when a craft with an uncrewed ModuleCommand but with a ModuleSPU was deemed non controllable. [#628]
* Flight Computer can be switched to "Off" instead of "KillRot" after maneuver execution or abort (configurable through settings file). [#631]
* Added a new "LeadTime" field (in settings file√† to control how much time attitude control is queued ahead of the maneuver (default 3 minutes like the previous hardocded value). [#631]
* Command Stations can now control themselves (if properly crewed and with the right SPU module) even if there's no one in a command module. [#633]
* Fixed various problems with the github readme and the user manual. [#669, #670, #680]
* Added current vessel name to flight computer (when UI is deployed). [#673]

Warning
=======

* CommNet is disabled by default if RemoteTech is enabled.
    - CommNet can still be enabled alongside RemoteTech in the RT option window but this has not been tested.
* If you enable CommNet, consider using 2 types of satellites:
    - Satellites with only RT antennas.
    - Satellites with only CommNet antennas.
    - Do not try to mix both: we won't fix these problems with *this* version of RemoteTech.

========================================
Released October 7, 2014

**WARNING:** this release changes the mod's folder and DLL names from `RemoteTech2` to `RemoteTech`. You must delete the old `RemoteTech2` directory before installing this version.

--------------------

* Compatible with KSP 0.25.
* The mod has officially been renamed from RemoteTech 2 to RemoteTech. Ignore the warning above at your own peril.
