@PART[RTShortAntenna1]:AFTER[RemoteTech] {
	@description = Hardy. Always on to start. Needed for a probe-only mission. Will work on any line of sight to KSC if below 150km altitude.
}

// Communotron 16 (Stock part repurposed for RT)
@PART[longAntenna]:AFTER[RemoteTech] {
	@description = Will work on any line of sight to KSC if below 1960km altitude (Below Keosynchronous)

	@description = Will work on any line of sight to KSC if below 2460km altitude (Just Below Keosynchronous)

	@description = Will work on any line of sight to KSC if below 4430km altitude (Well Above Keosynchronous)

@PART[mediumDishAntenna]:AFTER[RemoteTech] {
	@description = Reaches Minmus. Cone covers Keosynchronous at Mun.
}

// Reflectron KR-7
@PART[RTShortDish2]:AFTER[RemoteTech] {
	@description = Hardy. Reaches all of Kerbin SOI. Cone covers Kerbin well within Mun's orbit, Keosynchronous well within Minmus' orbit.
}

// Communotron 88-88 (Stock part repurposed for RT)
@PART[commDish]:AFTER[RemoteTech] {
	@description = Reaches Duna at all times, Dres on Kerbin's side of Sun. Cone covers Kerbin just outside of SOI. At Eve and Duna closest, cone will not cover Keosynchronous.
}

// Reflectron KR-14
@PART[RTLongDish2]:AFTER[RemoteTech] {
	@description = Hardy. Reaches Dres at all times, Jool on Kerbin's side of Sun, barely reaches Eeloo at its periapsis. Cone covers Kerbin from all planets. At Moho and Duna's closest approaches and when Eve is on the same side of Sun, cone will not cover Keosynchronous.
}

// CommTech-1
@PART[RTGigaDish2]:AFTER[RemoteTech] {
	@description = Hardy. Reaches everywhere. At Moho and Duna's closest approaches and when Eve is on the same side of Sun, cone will not cover Kerbin. On any inner planet (including Dres), Eeloo at closest approach, and Jool on the same side of Sun, cone will not cover Keosynchronous.
}

// Reflectron GX-128
@PART[RTGigaDish1]:AFTER[RemoteTech] {
	@description = Lightweight. Reaches everywhere. Cone will not cover Kerbin from low Sun orbit or Moho and Eve when on the same side of Sun, or a lot of Duna's close approach. All inner planets (including Dres) and Jool for all but when it on the opposite side of Sun, and about half of Eeloo's orbit the cone will not cover Keosynchronous.
