	RESULTS
	{
		default = Something is beeping. Is it supposed to do that?
		default = All signs point to this place being mostly harmless.
		default = The ground crew assess the situation.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The probe hasn't actually done anything... yet...
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The ground crew feels the need. The need for speed.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The ground control crew rejoice at the pinpoint landing in their back yard. Bobak Kerman is adamant that he totally meant to do that.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = There is something majestic to the view beamed to the monitors at KSC.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = Still no sign of the fabled kerbals in kilts.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Bobak Kerman proposes that we fly haphazardly between the mountains like in that movie he saw last night.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The camera gets covered with sand.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = This looks like a fun place trying to land on.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = There's something serene about the landscape. For a moment the ground control crew forget that they aren't watching a nature show and almost crash.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = Preliminary reports indicate that this would be a great place to store softdrinks.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = The crew agree to go surfing after the mission is over.
		KeringFlyingLowWater = The ground control crew is reminded that water and electronics generally don't mix that well.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The ground crew spontaneously high-five over the realisation that they sent something all the way up here without exploding.
		KerbinInSpace = Bobak Kerman gives an impromptu speach about the nature of awesome while live images of Kerbin beam back to KSC.

		MunInSpace = The first close up pictures of the Mun inspire awe at KSC. Also, a pillow fight for some reason.
		MunInSpace = The crew draw straws as to who gets to decide where to land. The inside of the craters might be the best option.

		MinmusInSpace = Judging by the color, the crew guess that the lakes should be frozen. They might be a good place to land.
		MinmusInSpace = The crew draw straws as to who gets to eat the delicious surface samples.

		GillyInSpace = It looks like a particularly lumpy rock.

		MohoInSpace = Bobak Kerman remarks that this might be the ideal planet to visit when he needs to work on his tan.

		EveInSpace = The ground crew theorize that the oceans might be comprised of rocket fuel.

		DunaInSpace = The rough terrain would be ideal for some offroad rover fun. Bobak Kerman is ecstatic.

		IkeInSpace = Landing here should be easy.

		DresInSpace = The surface has a patchwork of white and brown areas, with a few craters.

		JoolInSpace = The ground crew remark that nobody thought it would be this green.

		LaytheInSpace = Within minutes of the first images of Laythe beaming back to KSC, Bobak Kerman plans on building a beach house.

		VallInSpace = Judging from the color, the ground crew theorize that this moon is frozen solid.

		TyloInSpace = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. It also appears one side is more cratered then the other.

		BopInSpace = The ground crew theorize that this is a captured asteroid.

		PolInSpace = The terrain below looks very hazardous. Bobak Kerman can't wait to try and land here.

		EelooInSpace = Never before has Eeloo been viewed this close. The ground crew instantly print out the pictures on T-shirts.
