Before issuing a bug report, please follow the following steps:
* Read the titles of the open issues, does it sound familiar to your problem? Comment there instead of making a new one.
* Make sure the issue title is descriptive. "Losing connection above 10km" instead of "connection doesn't work".
* List all installed mods (preferably WITH version number) either in the issue body, on [gist](https://gist.github.com/)(Easy to edit later) or any [pa](http://fpaste.org)[ste](http://pastie.org/)[bin](http://pastebin.com/)-esque site.
* Provide your persistance save! This is ```Kerbal Space Program\saves\[yoursave]\persistent.sfs```, add it to your gist as a new file or as a seperate [pa](http://fpaste.org)[ste](http://pastie.org/)[bin](http://pastebin.com/).
